### 🎥 **Video Testimonials Script Templates**

#### **Career Switcher Testimonial**
```
[Setting: Professional home office]

"Hi, I'm Sarah Chen, and I'm a Software Engineer at Google.

But 18 months ago, I was working in retail management with no technical background.

The thing about CodeMentor AI that changed everything for me was the AI tutor. When I got stuck - which was often - Emma would give me just the right hint. Not the full solution, but enough to help me think through the problem.

The collaborative features were incredible too. I paired with developers from around the world, got code reviews, and built real connections.

But what really sealed the deal was the career support. The platform helped me build a portfolio, optimize my resume, and practice interviews.

When I got the call from Google, I knew CodeMentor AI had prepared me not just to code, but to succeed in the industry.

If you're thinking about learning to code, or switching careers like I did - this platform will get you there."

#### **Student Success Testimonial**
```
[Setting: University dorm room]

"I'm Alex Rodriguez, Computer Science student at MIT.

Even though I'm studying CS, CodeMentor AI has been a game-changer for my learning.

The university teaches theory, but CodeMentor AI teaches practical application. The challenges are based on real industry problems, not textbook exercises.

Plus, the AI tutor helps me understand concepts way better than just reading documentation. It's like having a TA available 24/7 who knows exactly where I'm struggling.

The best part? My coding interview skills improved dramatically. The mock interview feature prepared me for internship interviews at Facebook, Google, and Apple.

I landed internships at all three.

Whether you're self-taught or formally educated, CodeMentor AI makes you a better programmer."
