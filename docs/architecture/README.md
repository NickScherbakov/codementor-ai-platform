# üèóÔ∏è CodeMentor AI Architecture Documentation

This section provides comprehensive architectural documentation for the CodeMentor AI platform, including system diagrams, component interactions, and data flow patterns.

## üìã Architecture Overview

CodeMentor AI follows a **microservices architecture** pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript for the user interface
- **Backend API**: Node.js/Express server handling business logic
- **AI Engine**: Python Flask service for AI/ML operations
- **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence
- **Cache**: Redis for session management and caching
- **Code Execution**: Judge0 sandbox for secure code execution
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for observability

## üìö Documentation Structure

### [System Overview](./system-overview.md)
High-level system architecture showing all major components and their relationships.

### [Service Interaction](./service-interaction.md)
Detailed view of how microservices communicate with each other.

### [Data Flow](./data-flow.md)
Sequence diagrams showing data flow for key user scenarios.

### [Database Schema](./database-schema.md)
Entity-relationship diagrams for MongoDB collections and data models.

## üéØ Key Architectural Principles

### 1. **Microservices Architecture**
- Independent deployability of services
- Technology diversity (Node.js, Python, MongoDB, Redis)
- Fault isolation and resilience
- Horizontal scalability

### 2. **API-First Design**
- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specifications
- Consistent error handling and response formats
- Versioning strategy for backward compatibility
- Rate limiting and security controls

### 3. **Real-time Communication**
- WebSocket connections for live collaboration
- Event-driven architecture for notifications
- Pub/sub patterns for service communication
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX

### 4. **Security & Privacy**
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure code execution in sandboxed environment
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

### 5. **Observability**
- Comprehensive logging with structured formats
- Metrics collection with Prometheus
- Distributed tracing for request flows
- Health checks and monitoring dashboards

## üöÄ Deployment Architecture

The system supports multiple deployment scenarios:

- **Development**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Staging**: Docker Swarm for testing environments
- **Production**: Kubernetes for enterprise deployments
- **Cloud**: Support for AWS, GCP, and Azure

## üìä Performance Characteristics

- **API Response Time**: < 200ms (p95)
- **AI Response Generation**: < 2s (average)
- **Concurrent Users**: 10,000+ supported
- **Code Execution**: < 5s timeout per submission
- **Database Queries**: < 100ms (p95)

## üîÑ Data Flow Patterns

### Synchronous Patterns
- HTTP REST API calls between services
- Database queries and transactions
- External API integrations (OpenAI, Judge0)

### Asynchronous Patterns
- WebSocket real-time updates
- Background job processing
- Event-driven notifications
- Cache invalidation strategies

## üõ°Ô∏è Resilience & Reliability

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Automatic failover for external services
- Graceful degradation of AI features
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Data Consistency
- ACID transactions where needed
- Eventual consistency for non-critical data
- Conflict resolution for collaborative editing

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Service health monitoring
- Performance threshold alerts
- Error rate tracking
- Capacity planning metrics
