## 📈 Key Business Decisions Made

### 1. Pricing Strategy
**Decision:** Freemium B2C + Enterprise + API three-pillar model  
**Rationale:** Maximizes reach (free tier), recurring revenue (subscriptions), and scalability (enterprise + API)

**B2C Tiers:**
- Free (Learner): 5 AI interactions/day, 50 challenges
- Starter ($19/mo): Unlimited AI, 500 challenges, basic collaboration
- Pro ($49/mo): Everything + interview prep + portfolio builder + job matching
- Teams ($39/user): Everything + team features + admin controls

### 2. Geographic Expansion
**Decision:** English → Spanish → Brazil  
**Rationale:** 
- English markets have highest purchasing power and willingness to pay
- Spanish markets offer scale with shared language
- Brazil is largest LATAM market with unique opportunity

### 3. Compliance Priority
**Decision:** SOC 2 (HIGH) > FERPA (HIGH) > GDPR (MEDIUM)  
**Rationale:**
- SOC 2 required for 90% of enterprise deals
- FERPA needed for US education market (massive opportunity)
- GDPR for EU expansion (later priority)

### 4. Billing Currency
**Decision:** Primary USD with regional pricing  
**Rationale:**
- USD is global standard
- Regional discounts via purchasing power parity
- Simplifies accounting while remaining accessible

### 5. Go-to-Market
**Decision:** Product-led growth (PLG) for B2C + Outbound sales for Enterprise  
**Rationale:**
- PLG scales efficiently with low CAC
- Enterprise requires consultative selling
- Hybrid approach maximizes both segments

## 📞 Questions & Answers

### Q: Why focus on B2C first instead of Enterprise?
**A:** B2C provides faster feedback loops, builds brand awareness, and creates bottom-up demand for enterprise sales. The free tier acts as a lead generation engine.

### Q: Why not use higher prices to position as premium?
**A:** Our target market (career switchers, students) is price-sensitive. Lower price + high volume + upsells to Pro tier generates more revenue than premium-only strategy.

### Q: Why wait for SOC 2 before enterprise sales?
**A:** We can start enterprise pilots without certification, but most enterprise contracts require SOC 2. We balance early pilots (building case studies) with certification timeline.

### Q: Why Brazil after Spanish markets?
**A:** Brazil requires unique payment infrastructure (Pix, boleto) and Portuguese localization. Spanish markets share language, making simultaneous launch more efficient.

### Q: Can we hit $100M ARR in 3 years?
**A:** Yes, with execution. Comparable companies: Duolingo ($500M ARR), Coursera ($500M ARR), Udemy ($600M ARR). Market size supports $1B+ opportunity.
