# Money Page Reference (Hard Code Review MVP)

**Marketing / positioning reference for the Hard Code Review MVP**

## Headline
Hard Code Review like a strong team lead.

## Subheadline
Brutal, senior-level code review. Interview / team-lead judgment. No tutorials, no sugar-coating.

## Intent and Guardrails
- **Intended tone**: brutal, senior-level, interview-style feedback.
- **What this page is meant to communicate**: the MVP delivers strict, high-signal code review outcomes that feel like a senior team lead evaluating production readiness.
- **What it explicitly is NOT**: not a UI spec, not an implementation guide, and not a source of truth for frontend code.
